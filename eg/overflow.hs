-- Example taken from Lee Pike's paper on SmartCheck:
-- https://github.com/leepike/SmartCheck/blob/master/paper/paper.pdf
--
-- An enumerative testing library, using a standard enumeration for integers,
-- won't be able to find a counter-example.
--
-- However, if we tweak the enumeration to include extremely large integers
-- (32767, 32766, 32765...) intercalated with extremely small integers a
-- counter-example is found quickly.
--
-- See the 'X' type from "Test.LeanCheck.Utils.Types" for more details.
--
-- The technque shown here could be applied in other enumerative property-based
-- testing tools.
